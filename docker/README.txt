Before building the docker image, you will need to download Java JDK 1.7 in this directory:

	jdk-7u80-linux-x64.tar.gz

From Oracle's website at:

	https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/javase7-archive-downloads.html

To build the toolchain:

	./build.sh


To run the smoke tests (once it's built):
	
	./run-smoke-tests.sh
